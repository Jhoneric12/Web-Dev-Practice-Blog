                Let's be honest, guys: ALL of us are currently obsessed with the Netflix series <a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/why-should-you-watch-the-k-drama-start-up-a4575-20201115-lfrm">Start-Up.</a> We've been counting the days, hours, and minutes until it's the weekend again so we can either ugly cry or laugh out loud with each episode. Am I right?? Blink if you agree. 

                The K-drama is full of interesting characters who keep toying with our emotions. One moment, you will feel sorry for them. The next thing you know, you want to hit them in the head for their life decisions! I'm gonna say this—that's how I felt with the OG Samsan Tech team.
            </p>
            <p>
                The company was founded by Nam Do San (<a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/nam-joo-hyuk-korean-dramas-tv-shows-a4436-20190913-lfrm">Nam Joo Hyuk</a>) and was initially called Dosan Tech. Later on, the company's name was changed and he began building it from the ground up with his college-friends-slash-knitting-club-co-members, Kim Yong San (<a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/kim-do-wan-start-up-facts-a4575-20201121">Kim Do Wan</a>) and Lee Chul San (<a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/yoo-soo-bin-facts-a4575-20201204">Yoo Soo Bin</a>). The three funny guys all have "San" in their names, and three in Korean is <i>sam</i>, thus, Samsan Tech was born!

            <p>
                Sadly, it wasn't always easy for the plaid-wearing trio. In fact, Samsan Tech did not see any significant progress for years. But they're *very* determined to make their business successful. And they did get their big break, but still faced many challenges.

            <p>
                What makes the Samsan Tech team's friendship the best is that they've been through the worst but their ties remained strong. Do San, Yong San, and Chul San have had numerous fights but they also make up with each other immediately. They're the type of friends who are really more like family.

                As you continue watching the episodes of <i>Start-Up,</i> you will notice that the three don't always make smart conclusions. Their emotions would often get in the way, leading Samsan Tech to more difficulties. Here, let's dissect their characters and get to know them more:
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>1. Nam Joo Hyuk as Nam Do San</h2>
                <b>The character:</b>  Do San is a Math genius who is innately awkward and has low self-esteem. As the *real* Nam Do San, aka not the pen pal of Seo Dal Mi (<a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/bae-suzy-net-worth-a4575-20201123-lfrm"</a>), he's in a quest to win the leading lady's heart by being his true self. He may be a smart cookie, but the real world is totally new to him.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The actor:</b>  Nam Joo Hyuk brings out his soft side in this drama, showing viewers that he, too, can play an emotional character. He's shed so many tears in this drama far from his role in <a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/weightlifting-fairy-kim-bok-joo-review-a1652-20170210-lfrm">Weightlifting Fairy Kim Book Joo</a>, Joo Hyuk here has a deeper backstory.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>2. Kim Do Wan as Kim Yong San</h2>
                <b>The character:</b>  Driven AF, Yong San may seem like he's just going with the flow, but he actually has ameaningful reason why he wants Samsan Tech succeed. Out of the Thre, he can be emotional but he tries hard to contain his feelings, and would only explode when it gets erally bad.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The actor:</b>  Kim Do Wan is a superstar in the making! You can see how he prepares for his scenes well. There's a big reveal about his character, and man did he bring out his acting chops in that scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h2>3. Yoo Soo Bin as Lee Chul San</h2>
                <b>The character:</b>  Undoudtedly the funniest in Samsan Tech, Chul San is often armed with the best jokes and <i>hirits</i>, mostly towards (<a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/stephanie-lee-start-up--a4575-20201122">Stephanie Lee</a>)! He can get pretty emo at times but that's just him showing his concern towards others.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>The actor:</b>  You probably already know him as the adorable K-drama fan and one of the loyal soldiers in Captain Ri's (<a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/must-watch-hyun-bin-dramas-movies-a1204-20200125-lfrm">Hyun Bin</a> <a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/entertainment/crash-landing-on-you-soldiers-facts-bio-a483-20200123">Company of Five</a> in <a href="https://www.cosmo.ph/tag/crash-landing-on-you">Crash Landing On You</a>! Soo Bin is such a natural when it comes to playing his <i>Start-Up</i> character.
